And<br>now, as I said unto you, that because ye were<br>compelled to be humble ye were blessed, do ye not<br>suppose that they are more blessed who truly humble themselves<br>bec</span><br><span class="highlight-0">elled to be humble ye were blessed, do ye not<br>suppose that they are more blessed who truly humble themselves<br>because of the word?

Therefore, blessed are they who humble themselves without being<br>compelled to be humble; or rather, in other words, blessed<br>is he that believeth in the word of God, and<br>is baptized without stubbornness of heart, yea, without being brought<br>to kn</span><br><span class="highlight-2">that believeth in the word of God, and is baptized<br>without stubbornness of heart, yea, without being brought to know<br>the word, or even compelled to know, before they will<br>believe. Yea, there are many who do say: If th</span><br><span class="highlight-2">w the word, or even compelled to know, before they<br>will believe. Yea, there are many who do say: If<br>thou wilt show unto us a sign from heaven, then<br>we shall know of a surety; then we shall belie</span><br><span class="highlight-2">u wilt show unto us a sign from heaven, then<br>we shall know of a surety; then we shall believe.<br>Now I ask, is this faith? Behold, I say unto<br>you, Nay; for if a man knoweth a thing he<br>ha</span><br><span class="highlight-2">e. Now I ask, is this faith? Behold, I say<br>unto you, Nay; for if a man knoweth a thing<br>he hath no cause to believe, for he knoweth it.<br>And now, how much more cursed is he that knoweth<br>the w</span><br><span class="highlight-2">h no cause to believe, for he knoweth it. And<br>now, how much more cursed is he that knoweth the<br>will of God and doeth it not, than he that<br>only believeth, or only hath cause to believe, and falle</span><br><span class="highlight-2">ll of God and doeth it not, than he that<br>only believeth, or only hath cause to believe, and falleth<br>into transgression? Now of this thing ye must judge. Behold,<br>I say unto you, that it is on the one<br>h</span><br><span class="highlight-2">h into transgression? Now of this thing ye must judge.<br>Behold, I say unto you, that it is on the<br>one hand even as it is on the other; and<br>it shall be unto every man according to his work.<br>And n</span><br><span class="highlight-2">nd even as it is on the other; and it<br>shall be unto every man according to his work. And<br>now as I said concerning faith—faith is not to have<br>a perfect knowledge of things; therefore if ye have faith<br>y</span><br><span class="highlight-2">w as I said concerning faith—faith is not to have<br>a perfect knowledge of things; therefore if ye have faith<br>ye hope for things which are not seen, which are<br>true. And now, behold, I say unto you, and I<br>would</span><br><span class="highlight-2">hope for things which are not seen, which are true.<br>And now, behold, I say unto you, and I would<br>that ye should remember, that God is merciful unto all<br>who believe on his name; therefore he desireth, in the</span><br><span class="highlight-2">that ye should remember, that God is merciful unto all<br>who believe on his name; therefore he desireth, in the<br>first place, that ye should believe, yea, even on his<br>word. And now, he imparteth his word by angels</span><br><span class="highlight-2">irst place, that ye should believe, yea, even on his<br>word. And now, he imparteth his word by angels unto<br>men, yea, not only men but women also. Now this<br>is not all; little children do have words given u</span><br><span class="highlight-2">nto men, yea, not only men but women also. Now<br>this is not all; little children do have words given<br>unto them many times, which confound the wise and the<br>learned. And now, my beloved brethren, as ye have desired</span><br><span class="highlight-0">to them many times, which confound the wise and the<br>learned. And now, my beloved brethren, as ye have desired<br>to know of me what ye shall do because ye<br>are afflicted and cast out—now I do not desire that<br>ye s</span><br><span class="highlight-2">to know of me what ye shall do because ye<br>are afflicted and cast out—now I do not desire that<br>ye should suppose that I mean to judge you only<br>according to that which is true— For I do not<br>mean th</span><br><span class="highlight-2">ould suppose that I mean to judge you only according<br>to that which is true— For I do not mean<br>that ye all of you have been compelled to humble<br>yourselves; for I verily believe that there are some among</span><br><span class="highlight-0">t ye all of you have been compelled to humble<br>yourselves; for I verily believe that there are some among<br>you who would humble themselves, let them be in whatsoever<br>circumstances they might. Now, as I said concerning faith—that</span><br><span class="highlight-2">ou who would humble themselves, let them be in whatsoever<br>circumstances they might. Now, as I said concerning faith—that it<br>was not a perfect knowledge—even so it is with my<br>words. Ye cannot know of their surety at first, unto<br>per</span><br><span class="highlight-2">t was not a perfect knowledge—even so it is with<br>my words. Ye cannot know of their surety at first,<br>unto perfection, any more than faith is a perfect knowledge.<br>But behold, if ye will awake and arouse your faculties,<br>even</span><br><span class="highlight-2">ection, any more than faith is a perfect knowledge. But<br>behold, if ye will awake and arouse your faculties, even<br>to an experiment upon my words, and exercise a particle<br>of faith, yea, even if ye can no more than<br>desir</span><br><span class="highlight-2">to an experiment upon my words, and exercise a particle<br>of faith, yea, even if ye can no more than<br>desire to believe, let this desire work in you, even<br>until ye believe in a manner that ye can give<br>place</span><br><span class="highlight-2">to believe, let this desire work in you, even until<br>ye believe in a manner that ye can give place<br>for a portion of my words. Now, we will compare<br>the word unto a seed. Now, if ye give place,</span><br><span class="highlight-1">or a portion of my words. Now, we will compare<br>the word unto a seed. Now, if ye give place,<br>that a seed may be planted in your heart, behold,<br>if it be a true seed, or a good seed,<br>if</span><br><span class="highlight-1">hat a seed may be planted in your heart, behold,<br>if it be a true seed, or a good seed,<br>if ye do not cast it out by your unbelief,<br>that ye will resist the Spirit of the Lord, behol</span><br><span class="highlight-1">ye do not cast it out by your unbelief, that<br>ye will resist the Spirit of the Lord, behold, it<br>will begin to swell within your breasts; and when you<br>feel these swelling motions, ye will begin to say wi</span><br><span class="highlight-1">, it will begin to swell within your breasts; and<br>when you feel these swelling motions, ye will begin to<br>say within yourselves—It must needs be that this is a<br>good seed, or that the word is good, for it<br>beginneth</span><br><span class="highlight-1">hin yourselves—It must needs be that this is a good<br>seed, or that the word is good, for it beginneth<br>to enlarge my soul; yea, it beginneth to enlighten my<br>understanding, yea, it beginneth to be delicious to me. Now<br>behold</span><br><span class="highlight-1">o enlarge my soul; yea, it beginneth to enlighten my<br>understanding, yea, it beginneth to be delicious to me. Now<br>behold, would not this increase your faith? I say unto<br>you, Yea; nevertheless it hath not grown up to a<br>perfect k</span><br><span class="highlight-1">would not this increase your faith? I say unto you,<br>Yea; nevertheless it hath not grown up to a perfect<br>knowledge. But behold, as the seed swelleth, and sprouteth, and<br>beginneth to grow, then you must needs say that th</span><br><span class="highlight-1">owledge. But behold, as the seed swelleth, and sprouteth, and<br>beginneth to grow, then you must needs say that the<br>seed is good; for behold it swelleth, and sprouteth, and<br>beginneth to grow. And now, behold, will not this str</span><br><span class="highlight-1">seed is good; for behold it swelleth, and sprouteth, and<br>beginneth to grow. And now, behold, will not this strengthen<br>your faith? Yea, it will strengthen your faith: for ye<br>will say I know that this is a good seed;<br>f</span><br><span class="highlight-1">ngthen your faith? Yea, it will strengthen your faith: for<br>ye will say I know that this is a good<br>seed; for behold it sprouteth and beginneth to grow. And<br>now, behold, are ye sure that this is a good<br>seed? I</span><br><span class="highlight-1">r behold it sprouteth and beginneth to grow. And now,<br>behold, are ye sure that this is a good seed?<br>I say unto you, Yea; for every seed bringeth forth<br>unto its own likeness. Therefore, if a seed groweth it</span><br><span class="highlight-1">say unto you, Yea; for every seed bringeth forth unto<br>its own likeness. Therefore, if a seed groweth it is<br>good, but if it groweth not, behold it is not<br>good, therefore it is cast away. And now, be</span><br><span class="highlight-1">is good, but if it groweth not, behold it is<br>not good, therefore it is cast away. And now, behold,<br>because ye have tried the experiment, and planted the seed,<br>and it swelleth and sprouteth, and beginneth to grow</span><br><span class="highlight-1">old, because ye have tried the experiment, and planted the<br>seed, and it swelleth and sprouteth, and beginneth to grow,<br>ye must needs know that the seed is good. And<br>now, behold, is your knowledge perfect? Yea, your knowledge is</span><br><span class="highlight-1">ye must needs know that the seed is good. And<br>now, behold, is your knowledge perfect? Yea, your knowledge is<br>perfect in that thing, and your faith is dormant; and<br>this because you know, for ye know that the word<br>hat</span><br><span class="highlight-2">perfect in that thing, and your faith is dormant; and<br>this because you know, for ye know that the word<br>hath swelled your souls, and ye also know that it<br>hath sprouted up, that your understanding doth begin to be<br>enlig</span><br><span class="highlight-2">swelled your souls, and ye also know that it hath<br>sprouted up, that your understanding doth begin to be enlightened,<br>and your mind doth begin to expand. O then, is<br>not this real? I say unto you, Yea, because</span><br><span class="highlight-2">tened, and your mind doth begin to expand. O then,<br>is not this real? I say unto you, Yea, because<br>it is light; and whatsoever is light, is good, because<br>it is discernible, therefore ye must know that it is<br>good;</span><br><span class="highlight-2">it is light; and whatsoever is light, is good, because<br>it is discernible, therefore ye must know that it is<br>good; and now behold, after ye have tasted this light<br>is your knowledge perfect? Behold I say unto you, Nay;<br>ne</span><br><span class="highlight-2">nd now behold, after ye have tasted this light is<br>your knowledge perfect? Behold I say unto you, Nay; neither<br>must ye lay aside your faith, for ye have only<br>exercised your faith to plant the seed that ye migh</span><br><span class="highlight-1">ther must ye lay aside your faith, for ye have<br>only exercised your faith to plant the seed that ye<br>might try the experiment to know if the seed was<br>good. And behold, as the tree beginneth to grow, ye<br>will</span><br><span class="highlight-1">try the experiment to know if the seed was good.<br>And behold, as the tree beginneth to grow, ye will<br>say: Let us nourish it with great care, that it<br>may get root, that it may grow up, and brin</span><br><span class="highlight-1">ay: Let us nourish it with great care, that it<br>may get root, that it may grow up, and bring<br>forth fruit unto us. And now behold, if ye nourish<br>it with much care it will get root, and gro</span><br><span class="highlight-1">forth fruit unto us. And now behold, if ye nourish<br>it with much care it will get root, and grow<br>up, and bring forth fruit. But if ye neglect the<br>tree, and take no thought for its nourishment,</span><br><span class="highlight-1">up, and bring forth fruit. But if ye neglect the<br>tree, and take no thought for its nourishment, behold it<br>will not get any root; and when the heat of<br>the sun cometh and scorcheth it, because it hath n</span><br><span class="highlight-1">ehold it will not get any root; and when the<br>heat of the sun cometh and scorcheth it, because it<br>hath no root it withers away, and ye pluck it<br>up and cast it out. Now, this is not because<br>the s</span><br><span class="highlight-1">root it withers away, and ye pluck it up and<br>cast it out. Now, this is not because the seed<br>was not good, neither is it because the fruit thereof<br>would not be desirable; but it is because your g</span><br><span class="highlight-1">ed was not good, neither is it because the fruit<br>thereof would not be desirable; but it is because your<br>ground is barren, and ye will not nourish the tree,<br>therefore ye cannot have the fruit thereof. And thus, if<br>ye w</span><br><span class="highlight-1">ound is barren, and ye will not nourish the tree,<br>therefore ye cannot have the fruit thereof. And thus, if<br>ye will not nourish the word, looking forward with an<br>eye of faith to the fruit thereof, ye can never<br>pluc</span><br><span class="highlight-1">ll not nourish the word, looking forward with an eye<br>of faith to the fruit thereof, ye can never pluck<br>of the fruit of the tree of life. But if<br>ye will nourish the word, yea, nourish the tree</span><br><span class="highlight-1">of the fruit of the tree of life. But if<br>ye will nourish the word, yea, nourish the tree as<br>it beginneth to grow, by your faith with great diligence,<br>and with patience, looking forward to the fruit thereof</span><br><span class="highlight-1">s it beginneth to grow, by your faith with great<br>diligence, and with patience, looking forward to the fruit thereof,<br>it shall take root; and behold it shall be a<br>tree springing up unto everlasting life. And because of your<br>d</span><br><span class="highlight-1">it shall take root; and behold it shall be a<br>tree springing up unto everlasting life. And because of your<br>diligence and your faith and your patience with the word<br>in nourishing it, that it may take root in you,<br>beho</span><br><span class="highlight-1">ligence and your faith and your patience with the word<br>in nourishing it, that it may take root in you,<br>behold, by and by ye shall pluck the fruit thereof,<br>which is most precious, which is sweet above all that<br>is</span><br><span class="highlight-1">d, by and by ye shall pluck the fruit thereof,<br>which is most precious, which is sweet above all that<br>is sweet, and which is white above all that is<br>white, yea, and pure above all that is pure; and<br>ye s</span><br><span class="highlight-1">sweet, and which is white above all that is white,<br>yea, and pure above all that is pure; and ye<br>shall feast upon this fruit even until ye are filled,<br>that ye hunger not, neither shall ye thirst.
